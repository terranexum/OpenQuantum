## Current Requirements for a Quantum Computer

The [essential hardware components of a quantum computer](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/25196/chapter/7) and its design constraints can be summarized as follows:

Qubits: the fundamental building blocks of a quantum computer. They must be able to maintain long coherence times to avoid errors. Currently, the most promising qubit technologies are superconducting qubits and trapped ions.

Control electronics: required to manipulate the qubits and perform quantum operations. These electronics must be able to generate and control precise microwave and radiofrequency signals.

Cryogenic infrastructure: Qubits must be operated at extremely low temperatures, typically around 10 millikelvin. This requires sophisticated cryogenic infrastructure to maintain a stable and cold environment.

Readout electronics: To extract the results of a quantum computation, the state of each qubit must be measured. This requires highly sensitive readout electronics capable of distinguishing small differences in the qubit state.

Interconnects: In larger quantum computers, it is necessary to connect multiple qubits together to perform more complex computations. However, quantum information is fragile and can be easily lost, so interconnects must be carefully designed to avoid introducing errors.

## Current Constraints on Quantum Computer Design

1) There is a strong need to maintain long coherence times, which requires careful attention to materials, design, and operating conditions. 
2) The control electronics and readout infrastructure must be highly precise to manipulate and measure qubits accurately. 

These constraints make the development of a large-scale quantum computer both highly challenging and interdisciplinary.

## The Importance of Quantum Superposition, Entanglement, and Interference

Quantum superposition is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics that allows qubits to represent quantum states that are more numerous and complex than the two states (0 and 1) of classical bits. In quantum superposition, a qubit can exist in multiple states simultaneously, and these states are represented by a combination of probability amplitudes. This means that a single qubit can represent multiple values simultaneously, allowing for much more efficient computation than classical bits.

In addition to superposition, quantum computers rely on the principles of entanglement and quantum interference to perform computations. Entanglement allows multiple qubits to become correlated in ways that cannot be explained by classical physics, while quantum interference allows quantum states to interact in ways that amplify certain outcomes and suppress others. Together, these principles enable quantum computers to perform certain types of calculations much faster than classical computers.

## Analogues to Quantum Superposition, Entanglement, and Interference

### Analogues to Quantum Superposition

There are other cases in nature where objects or waves can exist in multiple states simultaneously.

1) Wave-particle duality from quantum mechanics: particles such as electrons and photons can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on the type of experiment being performed. In certain experiments, these particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously, just like qubits in a quantum computer.

2) Superposition from classical physics: waves can also exhibit superposition, where multiple waves can coexist and interfere with each other. For example, when two sound waves of different frequencies interact, they can create a new wave that exhibits the characteristics of both original waves.

### Analogues to Quantum Entanglement

Entanglement occurs when the quantum states of two or more qubits become correlated in such a way that the state of one qubit is dependent on the state of the other qubit, even when they are far apart. This is called a nonlocal correlation, not explainable by any classical physics mechanisms.

To entangle two qubits, first they must be in a superposition of states. Entanglement then results in their individual states becoming correlated, so that if the state of one qubit was measured, the state of the other qubit will be known with a certain probability. Either qubit's state is not possible to know until it is measured, and once measured, this will affect the state of the other qubit, regardless of distance.

This correlation can be measured by performing a joint measurement of the entangled qubits. This measurement can reveal the degree of correlation between the qubits, and can provide information about the state of one qubit based on the state of the other qubit. However, because the state of each qubit is not determined until it is measured, the results of these measurements are probabilistic.

Entanglement plays a key role in quantum computing, as it allows multiple qubits to work together to perform computations that are impossible to perform with classical bits. This cooperation of multiple qubits through some kind of inter-qubit connectivity is the value that quantum entanglement lends to problems that would otherwise not be solvable in a reasonable time.

#### Classical Correlation Functions between Two Objects or Waves

Two objects or waves can achieve correlated states that are measurable with some probability. For example, consider two classical waves that are correlated in a certain way. One way to measure this correlation is to calculate the correlation function, a mathematical function that describes how the amplitudes of the waves are related to each other at different positions and times. The correlation function is calculated by taking the product of the wave amplitudes at different positions and times and averaging over many measurements. The result of this calculation is a measure of the correlation between the two waves, which can be used to predict the behavior of one wave based on the behavior of the other wave.

Similarly, in quantum mechanics, correlation functions can also be used to measure the correlation between quantum states. In this case, the correlation function is calculated using the probability amplitudes of the quantum states, and it describes the statistical relationship between the quantum states at different times and locations.

If quantum correlations were local instead of nonlocal, quantum computers would still be able to operate, but they would not have the same computational power as they do with nonlocal correlations.

Quantum computers rely on entanglement, which is a type of nonlocal correlation, to perform certain computational tasks more efficiently than classical computers. For example, Shor's algorithm, which is used to factor large numbers, relies on entanglement to search an exponentially large solution space in a much faster time than classical algorithms. However, there are quantum algorithms that do not rely on entanglement, such as Grover's algorithm, which uses interference and superposition to achieve computational speedup.

### Analogues to Quantum Interference

In quantum interference, quantum waves can combine and interfere with each other in a way that can lead to constructive or destructive interference patterns. This interference is a purely quantum effect that arises from the wave-like behavior of particles and it is not possible in classical systems composed of objects and waves.

In classical systems, waves can also interfere with each other, leading to constructive or destructive interference patterns. For example, when two water waves meet each other, they can interfere with each other to produce a pattern of crests and troughs that either reinforce or cancel each other out. This interference pattern can be observed on the surface of the water.

However, the interference in classical systems is fundamentally different from quantum interference. In classical systems, the waves are continuous and well-defined, and the interference patterns can be explained by the superposition of these waves. In contrast, in quantum systems, particles are described by probability amplitudes that can interfere with each other, leading to interference patterns that are not explainable by the superposition of classical waves.

Another important difference between quantum and classical interference is that quantum interference can result in entanglement. For example, if two entangled particles are sent through a double-slit experiment, their interference patterns will be correlated, even if they are far apart. This entanglement is a purely quantum effect that has no classical analogue.

## Analog Computers (vs. Digital)

Analog computers use physical quantities, such as voltages or currents, to represent variables in a mathematical equation, and they manipulate these physical quantities using analog circuitry to solve the equation. Analog computers can perform certain computations faster and more accurately than digital computers because they do not need to convert between digital and analog signals.

In an analogue of a quantum computer based on superposition, sound waves of different frequencies could be used to represent quantum bits or qubits. By combining these waves using Fourier analysis, it would be possible to create a wave that represents the superposition of many different quantum states.

In an analogue of a quantum computer based on entanglement, two waves with a correlation function describing how the amplitudes of the waves are related to each other at different positions and times could be used to represent entangled qubits. By manipulating one wave, it would be possible to predict the behavior of the other wave, just as in entangled quantum systems.

In an analogue of a quantum computer based on interference, constructive or destructive interference patterns could arise between two or more waves, just as in quantum systems. By manipulating the phases and amplitudes of these waves, it would be possible to perform computations based on interference patterns.

While analog computers can perform certain computations faster and more accurately than digital computers, they have limitations in terms of their precision, scalability, and complexity. Additionally, the principles of superposition, entanglement, and interference in classical systems are fundamentally different from their quantum counterparts, so an analogue of a quantum computer based on these principles would not have the same computational power as a true quantum computer.

## Wave Computers - Low Energy, Low Cost, Quantum-Like Computing at Room Temperature?

An analogue of a quantum computer based on superposition, entanglement, and interference would likely require a combination of electronic circuitry and wave generation and manipulation techniques.

To implement the superposition of qubits in an analogue quantum computer, wave generators could be used to create sound waves of different frequencies, which could be combined using Fourier analysis to produce a wave that represents the superposition of many different quantum states. Electronic circuits would be needed to manipulate the amplitudes and phases of these waves, which would correspond to the manipulation of qubits in a quantum computer.

For entanglement, two waves with a correlation function describing how the amplitudes of the waves are related to each other at different positions and times could be used to represent entangled qubits. Electronic circuits could be used to manipulate one wave and measure the behavior of the other wave, which would correspond to the manipulation and measurement of entangled qubits in a quantum computer.

In terms of interference, constructive or destructive interference patterns could arise between two or more waves, just as in quantum systems. By manipulating the phases and amplitudes of these waves using electronic circuits, it would be possible to perform computations based on interference patterns.
