Apparently there are quantum states accessible in every plant leaf, in what are called exciton condensates. Which means that low-cost, low-energy, room-temp quantum computing appears to be possible. We want to make that technology open and accessible, to help us solve a wide range of optimization and other problems, not the least of which would help our work under our [OpenQGO](https://github.com/terranexum/OpenQGO) project.

If the following work is of value to you, please consider supporting our work or joining as a Core Contributor through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/terranexum/projects/openquantum). 

Our goal is for our Core Contributors to each earn an equal share of 50% of the proceeds we receive from OpenEnergy products that get to market to get emissions reduced. Sustainability is not just for the planet, it has to be for people too.

## Summary

There are three quantum properties that quantum computers can make use of: superposition, entanglement, and interference. Our previous research, as outlined in the Wave_Computer document in this repo, sought to find reasonable enough analogues for these in classical systems that could be assembled together to form a "wave computer" - named so because it may be the behavior and control of waves that may make it possible for a low energy, low cost, computational device to exist at room temperature. 

Whether a wave computer could be built to achieve the high qubit densities and problem-solving capabilities needed to reach quantum advantage remained a question until we became aware of University of Chicago's work this morning. Now it seems quite possible, given how today circuit fabrication is widely accessible and can be used to create constantly changing phased arrays of focused waves much easier than fabricating the control electronics for qubits in standard ultra-cold quantum computers. 

Thus, we believe this project would be a worthy undertaking for those with open hardware experience.

Please see the Project_Plan document here for the three-month project we hope to complete with our community's help this summer.
